FORGEall: A Deep Learning Framework to Reliably Predict High Yield Strength High-Entropy Alloys for Hypersonic Engine

In 2004, Yeh and Cantor introduced high-entropy alloys (HEAs) with 5 to 13 elements. Since then, researchers have pursued HEAs for their potential to outperform traditional alloys. Specifically, AlCoCrFeNi HEAs offer low density and high-temperature yield strength (YS), making them suitable for hypersonic scramjet environments. However, the vast number of elemental and preparation combinations create significant experimental challenges. Deep learning can predict HEA properties from millions of compositions; however, current methods often overfit by relying on original dataset values, thereby missing complex nonlinear interactions between properties. FORGEall addresses these issues by providing an innovative approach to discovering high-yield-strength HEAs through feature transposition while maintaining model accuracy. Devising latent space projections through a novel semi-supervised sparse autoencoder and incorporating K-Nearest Neighbor regression, FORGEall improves generalization, achieving 98% accuracy in YS predictions. Furthermore, this framework combines elemental composition, thermodynamic properties, and processing conditions—areas often neglected in existing methods. FORGEall’s top two HEAs achieve YS values of 1850 MPa, ideal for hypersonic engines. Independent simulations using LAMMPS molecular dynamics validate the predictions within 0.6% and 3.8%. Additionally, simulations using Ovito attribute this performance to high lattice distortion, while ThermoCalc-CALPHAD indicates high-temperature phase stability. These HEAs, with high strength-to-weight ratios (densities < 9 g/cm3) and low costs, outperform current industry alloys. Thus, FORGEall enables efficient exploration of compositional spaces for fatigue-resistant hypersonic engine materials.
