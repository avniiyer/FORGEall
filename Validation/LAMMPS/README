LAMMPS input files, to be run in windows or linux environment by calling the compand lmp.in -in\filename
my_stressed_HEA_trial6_1: includes structural input file and stress-strain simulation for FORGEall alloy-1
my_stressed_HEA_trial6_2: includes structural input file and stress-strain simulation for FORGEall alloy-2
*lmp files generated by these can be uploaded onto Ovito to show alloys

plotting_stress_strain_curves: uses .txt file generated by LAMMPS to generate stress-strain curves and 0.2% offset line
